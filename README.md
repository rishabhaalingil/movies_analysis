# Objective
The objective of this project is to find the correlation between the  Budget and Gross Income.The hypothesis is that the that budget allocated to a movie is directly proportional to its gross income.It is also assumed that there is a direct correlation between the Company's name and Gross Income.So this project aims to find whether the above mentioned hypothesis are right or wrong.

# Steps Involved/Project Highlights
1. Data Import:The data was downloaded from kaggle and then imported into jupyter notebooks using the pandas library.
2. Data Cleaning:Started by meticulously cleaning the dataset, including checking for and removing duplicates.Ensured data integrity by handling NaN values, either by removing them or replacing them with zeros in 
   numerical columns.
3. Data Extraction:Extracted the release year from the date column, organizing it into a separate column for better analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis:Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and employed statistical methods, particularly the Pearson correlation coefficient, to quantify the relationships between various     
   columns.
 # Visualizations:
Transformed the study findings into an entertaining and informative dashboard. Using Python's visualization modules (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), created a visually appealing data representation that provide a dynamic picture of observed correlations and trends.

# Key Insights
1. Budget-Gross Income Correlation: The analysis examined the relationship between the budget allocated to a movie and its gross income at the box office. The hypothesis predicted that a higher budget would lead 
   to higher gross income. The results confirmed this hypothesis, revealing a strong positive correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.74. This suggests that, generally, movies with larger production 
   budgets  tend to perform better financially, likely due to factors such as more extensive marketing, higher-quality production, and the ability to attract top talent. However, while the correlation is strong, 
   it is  important to note that the relationship is not perfect, meaning other factors beyond budget also contribute to a movie's financial success.
2. Company's Impact on Gross Income: The second analysis aimed to explore whether the production company's name influenced the gross income of a movie. It was initially expected that movies produced by renowned 
   production companies (such as Disney, Warner Bros., etc.) would perform better financially due to brand recognition, established fan bases, and resources available for high-quality production. However, the 
   analysis revealed no significant correlation between the production company and the movie’s gross income. This suggests that, while a well-known production company may provide certain advantages, other factors 
   — such as movie content, cast, marketing, and audience reception—play a more pivotal role in determining financial success. This finding challenges the common assumption that a company's name alone 
   significantly impacts box office performance
